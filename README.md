# super-expressive-py

super-expressive-py is a Python library that follows the 
[Super Expressive](https://github.com/bassim/super-expressive) approach to
bbuilding regular expressions in almost natural language - with no extra 
dependencies, and a lightweight code footprint.

It is based on [Super Expressive](https://github.com/bassim/super-expressive)
and adopts a similar fluent interface, while adapting for Python specifics.
